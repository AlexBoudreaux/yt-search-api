- **UI**: A sleek and responsive user interface, deployed at [yt-search-ui.vercel.app](https://yt-search-ui.vercel.app/).
- **Database**: Hosted on Supabase, provides structured storage and efficient retrieval of video data. Dashboard available at [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bbrcyfqrvwqbboudayre).
- **API**: Hosted on Google Cloud Run, provides a scalable and secure backend service. API accessible at [Hosted API URL](https://yt-search-api-d6kibk2c6q-ue.a.run.app).

## Running the Flask App Locally

To run the Flask server locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
   ```

5. **Run the Flask App:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Your local server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
